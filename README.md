**Hi there** ðŸ™Œ

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at **The University of Hong Kong (HKU)**, where I have the privilege of being jointly supervised by [Prof. Reynold C.K. Cheng](https://www.reynold.hku.hk/), [Prof. Francis C.M. Lau](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~fcmlau/), and [Prof. Yupeng Li](https://imd.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/Dr-Yupeng-LI.html). Prior to HKU, I had the great fortune of being advised by [Prof. Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/) at **Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen** and **Shanghai AI Laboratory**, as well as [Prof. Zhen Ming (Jack) Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dbzTZhcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at **York University**.

I have contributed as a core developer and maintainer to the open-source project [Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion) and I am the creator of the [Emilia](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amphion/Emilia-Dataset) dataset and its associated data preprocessing pipeline. As of December, 2024, Emilia was downloaded over 100k times by more than 1.5k research institutions, including Stanford, CMU, OpenAI, Google, and NVIDIA. It serves as the training set of almost all SOTA text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis model, including [F5-TTS](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS), [MaskGCT](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion/blob/main/models/tts/maskgct/README.md), and [OuteTTS](https://huggingface.co/OuteAI/OuteTTS-0.2-500M).


My current research interests focus on *Social Computing* and *AI for Social Good*.
