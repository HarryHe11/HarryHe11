**Hi there** ðŸ™Œ

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at **The University of Hong Kong (HKU)**, fortunate to be under the joint supervision of [Prof. Reynold C.K. Cheng](https://www.reynold.hku.hk/), [Prof. Francis C.M. Lau](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~fcmlau/), and [Prof. Yupeng Li](https://imd.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/Dr-Yupeng-LI.html). 

Before HKU, I was also fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and [Prof. Zhen Ming (Jack) Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dbzTZhcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at York University. As a core developer and maintainer, I contributed to the open-source project [Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion). I was the creator of the [Emilia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05361) dataset and the [Emilia-Pipe](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion/tree/main/preprocessors/Emilia) preprocessing pipeline.

My current research interests primarily revolve around *Social Computing* and *AI for Social Good*.
