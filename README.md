**Hi there** 🙌

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at **The University of Hong Kong (HKU)**, privileged to be jointly supervised by [Prof. Reynold C.K. Cheng](https://www.reynold.hku.hk/), [Prof. Francis C.M. Lau](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~fcmlau/), and [Prof. Yupeng Li](https://imd.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/Dr-Yupeng-LI.html). Before joining HKU, I had the honor of working under [Prof. Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/) at the **Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen** and the **Shanghai AI Laboratory**, where I contributed as a core developer and maintainer for the open-source project [Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion), and [Prof. Zhen Ming (Jack) Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dbzTZhcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at **York University** as a Mitacs Research Intern.  

I am the creator of [Emilia](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amphion/Emilia-Dataset), a leading dataset in expressive and spontaneous text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, along with its preprocessing pipeline, [Emilia-Pipe](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion/blob/main/preprocessors/Emilia/README.md). As of December 2024, Emilia has been downloaded over 100,000 times by more than 1,500 research institutions, including Stanford, CMU, OpenAI, Google, and NVIDIA. It has become a foundational training dataset for state-of-the-art TTS models such as [F5-TTS](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS), [MaskGCT](https://huggingface.co/amphion/MaskGCT), and [Vevo](https://huggingface.co/amphion/Vevo).  

My current research interests revolve around *Social Computing* and *Large Language Models (LLMs)*, where I aim to leverage LLMs to address critical societal challenges such as misinformation, fake news, and deepfakes.
