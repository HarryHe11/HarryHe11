**Hi there** 🙌

I am a second-year *Ph.D. student in Computer Science* at **The University of Hong Kong (HKU)** and a Senior Research Assistant at **Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU)**, jointly supervised by [Prof. Francis C.M. Lau](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~fcmlau/), [Prof. Reynold C.K. Cheng](https://www.reynold.hku.hk/), and [Prof. Ivan Y.P. Li](https://imd.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/Prof-Yupeng-LI.html). Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant under [Prof. Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/) at the **Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Shenzhen** and the **Shanghai AI Laboratory**, and as a Mitacs Research Intern under [Prof. Zhen Ming (Jack) Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dbzTZhcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at **York University (YorkU)**. I hold a *B.Eng. in Software Engineering* from **Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT)**, where I received the Outstanding Bachelor's Thesis Award.

I am the creator of [Emilia](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amphion/Emilia-Dataset), a leading dataset for expressive and spontaneous text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, and its preprocessing pipeline, [Emilia-Pipe](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion/blob/main/preprocessors/Emilia/README.md). Emilia has surpassed **1 Million** downloads from over 1,000 institutions and companies worldwide, including Stanford, CMU, OpenAI, Google, and NVIDIA. It is the "most liked dataset" in the audio category on HuggingFace and serves as a foundational training dataset for state-of-the-art TTS models like [F5-TTS](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS), [MaskGCT](https://huggingface.co/amphion/MaskGCT), [IndexTTS-2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21619), [ZipVoice](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13053), as well as Speech LLMs such as [Kimi-Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18425), [VITA-Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03739), and [Ming-Omni](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09344).


My current research interests revolve around *Social Computing* and *Large Language Models (LLMs)*, where I aim to leverage LLMs to address critical societal challenges such as misinformation, fake news, and deepfakes.
