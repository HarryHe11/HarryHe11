**Hi there** ðŸ™Œ

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at **The University of Hong Kong (HKU)**, where I have the privilege of being jointly supervised by [Prof. Reynold C.K. Cheng](https://www.reynold.hku.hk/), [Prof. Francis C.M. Lau](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~fcmlau/), and [Prof. Yupeng Li](https://imd.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/Dr-Yupeng-LI.html). 

Prior to joining HKU, I had the great fortune of being advised by [Prof. Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/) at **Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen** and **Shanghai AI Laboratory**, as well as [Prof. Zhen Ming (Jack) Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dbzTZhcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at **York University**. I have contributed as a core developer and maintainer to the open-source project [Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion) and I am the creator of the [Emilia](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amphion/Emilia-Dataset) dataset and its associated data preprocessing pipeline. Within a month of release, Emilia was downloaded over 10k times by more than 400 prestigious research institutions, including Stanford, CMU, OpenAI, Google, and NVIDIA.

My current research interests focus on *Social Computing* and *AI for Social Good*.
