**Hi there** 🙌

My name is Haorui He (何昊睿). I am a PhD student at **The University of Hong Kong (HKU)** in Computer Science, fortunate to be under the joint supervision of [Prof. Reynold C.K. Cheng](https://www.reynold.hku.hk/), [Prof. Francis C.M. Lau](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~fcmlau/), and [Prof. Yupeng Li](https://imd.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/Dr-Yupeng-LI.html). Before HKU, I was also fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and [Prof. Zhen Ming (Jack) Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dbzTZhcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at York University. 

My current research interests primarily revolve around *Social Computing* and *AI for Social Good*.
