**Hi there** 🙌

I am a second year *Ph.D. student in Computer Science* at **The University of Hong Kong (HKU)** and a Research Assistant at **Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU)**, jointly supervised by [Prof. Francis C.M. Lau](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~fcmlau/), [Prof. Reynold C.K. Cheng](https://www.reynold.hku.hk/), and [Prof. Yupeng Li](https://imd.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/Dr-Yupeng-LI.html). Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant under [Prof. Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/) at the **Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen** and the **Shanghai AI Laboratory**, and as a Mitacs Research Intern under [Prof. Zhen Ming (Jack) Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dbzTZhcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at **York University (YorkU)**. I hold a *B.Eng. in Software Engineering* from **Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT)**, where I received the Outstanding Bachelor's Thesis Award.

I am the creator of [Emilia](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amphion/Emilia-Dataset), a leading dataset for expressive and spontaneous text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, and its preprocessing pipeline, [Emilia-Pipe](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion/blob/main/preprocessors/Emilia/README.md). As of May 2025, Emilia has surpassed 500,000 downloads by over 1,000 institutions and companies, including Stanford, CMU, OpenAI, Google, and NVIDIA. It is the "most liked dataset" in the audio category on HuggingFace and serves as a foundational training dataset for state-of-the-art TTS models like [F5-TTS](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS), [MaskGCT](https://huggingface.co/amphion/MaskGCT), and [SparkTTS](https://github.com/SparkAudio/Spark-TTS), as well as audio language models such as [Kimi-Audio](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Audio/blob/master/assets/kimia_report.pdf), [VITA-Audio](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03739), and [Ming-Omni](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09344).

My current research interests revolve around *Social Computing* and *Large Language Models (LLMs)*, where I aim to leverage LLMs to address critical societal challenges such as misinformation, fake news, and deepfakes.
