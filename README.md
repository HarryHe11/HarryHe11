**Hi there** ðŸ™Œ

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at **The University of Hong Kong (HKU)**, fortunate to be under the joint supervision of [Prof. Reynold C.K. Cheng](https://www.reynold.hku.hk/), [Prof. Francis C.M. Lau](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~fcmlau/), and [Prof. Yupeng Li](https://imd.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/Dr-Yupeng-LI.html). 

Before HKU, I was also fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and [Prof. Zhen Ming (Jack) Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dbzTZhcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at York University.  As a core developer and maintainer, I contributed to the open-source project [Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion). Besides, I was the creator of the [Emilia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05361) dataset and its associated pipeline. Within three days of its release, Emilia received download requests from over 200 prestigious research institutions, including Stanford, CMU, OpenAI, Google, and NVIDIA.

My current research interests primarily revolve around *Social Computing* and *AI for Social Good*.
